Scale-up: for many input flight files:

* move new files to new_input dir

* process each file in the new_input dir in parallel

* each input file will produce one output file in new_output dir

* move input file to processed_input dir

* A New script to process files in new_output dir
    and add data to acc_output file

* move output files to processed_output dir

e. g.
    input_file1 -> output_file1 = [['Sweden', 100, 50]]
    output_file1 -> acc_output = [['Sweden', 100, 50]]

    input_fileN -> output_fileN = [['USA', 200, 30], ['Sweden', 77, 5]]
    output_fileN -> acc_output = [['USA', 200, 30], ['Sweden', 177, 55]]
